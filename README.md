# AMACA
Adaptive methods for accelerating convolution operators in different numeric precision settings and sparsity conditions

AMACA studies supervised learning techniques to accelerate the convolutional layers of CNNs.
AMACA allows for multi-objective optimization, leveraging algorithmic setting to balance accuracy, performance and power consumption. 

At the moment, the project focuses on the ARM Compute Library (ARMCL) and its four convolution implementations.
